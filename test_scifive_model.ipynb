w/ abx x2 batches. indication: the pt is an 84-yr-old f w significant endstage osteoarthritis of the l knee who has had rapid progression w/ pain and disability. surg was indicated to relieve her pain and improve her fxal ability. goal objectives and the procedure were discussed w/ the pt. risks and benefits were explained. no guarantees have been made or implied. informed consent was obtained. description of the procedure: the pt was taken to the or and once an adequate spinal anesthesia w duramorph was achieved her l le was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion. a nonsterile tourniquet was placed proxly in the thigh. abx were infused prior to f/c insertion. time-out procedure was called. a straight longitudinal ant midline incision was made. dissection was carried down sharply down the skin sc tissue and the fascia. deep fascia was exposed. the tourniquet was inflated at 300 mmhg prior to the skin incision. a standard medial parapatellar approach was made. the quadriceps tendon was incised approx 1 cm from the vastus medialis insertion. incision was then carried down distly and dist arthrotomy was completed. patellar tendon was well protected. retinaculum and cap was incised approx 5 mm from the medial border of the patella for later repair. the knee was exposed very well. significant tricompartmental osteoarthritis was noted. the osteophytes were removed w/ a rongeur. ant and post cruciate ligs were excised. medial and lat meniscectomies were performed. medial dissection was performed subperiosteally along the medial aspect of the prox tibia to address the varus deformity. the medial compartment was more affected than lat. medial ligs were tied. retropatellar fat pad was excised. osteophytes were removed. using a cobb elevator the medial soft tissue periosteum envelope was well reflected. attention was placed for the preparation of the femur. the trochlear notch was ossified. a rongeur was utilized to identify the notch and then using an im drill guide a starting hole was created slightly ant to the pcl attachment. the ant portal was 1 cm ant to the pcl attachment. the ant fempo sizer was positioned keeping 3 degrees of etx rotation. rotation was also verified using the transepicondylar axis and whiteside line. the pins were positioned in the appropriate holes. ant fempo cut was performed post placing the cutting guide. now the dist cutting guide was attached to the alignment and 5 degrees of valgus cut was planned. a dist fempo cut was made which was satisfactory. a sizer was positioned which was noted to be d. the 5-in-1 cutting block size d was secured w spring pins over the resected bone. using an oscillating saw cuts were made in a sequential manner such as ant condyle post condyle ant chamfer and post chamfer. then using a reciprocating saw intercondylar base notch cut and side cuts were made. following this the cutting block for high-flex knee was positioned taking 2 mm of additional post condyle. using a reciprocating saw the side cuts were made and bony intercondylar notch cut was completed. the bone w/ its attached soft tissue was removed. once the fempo preparation was completed attention was placed for the preparation of the tibia. the medial and the lat collat ligs were well protected w/ a retractor. the pcl retractor was positioned and the tibia was translated antly. osteophytes were removed. the extramedullary tibial alignment guide was affixed to the tibia and appropriate amt of etx rotation was considered reference to the medial 1/3rd of the tibial tubercle. similarly horseshoe alignment guide was positioned and the alignment guide was well aligned to the dist 1/3rd of the crest of the tibia as well as the 2nd toe. once the alignment was verified in a coronal plane the tibial em guide was well secured and then post slope was also aligned keeping the alignment rod parallel to the tibial crest. a built-in 7-degree post slope was considered w instrumentation. now the 2 mm stylus arm was positioned over the cutting block medially which was the most affected site. tibial osteotomy was completed 90 degrees to the mech axis in the coronal plane. the resected thickness of the bone was satisfactory taken 2 mm from the most affected site. the resected surface shows some sclerotic bone medially. now attention was placed for the removal of the post osteophytes from the fempo condyle. using curved osteotome angle curette and a rongeur the post osteophytes were removed. now attention was placed for confirming the flexion-extension gap balance using a 10 mm spacer block in extension and 12 mm in flexion. rectangular gap was achieved w/ appropriate soft tissue balance in both flexion and extension. the 12 mm spacer block was satisfactory w/ good stability in flexion and extension. attention was now placed for completion of the tibia. size 2 tibial trial plate was positioned. appropriate etx rotation was maintained w the help of the horseshoe alignment rod. reference to the tibial crest distly and 2nd toe was considered as ante. the midpoint of the trial tray was collinear w/ the medial 1/3rd of the tibial tubercle. the rotation of tibial plate was satisfactory as required and the preparation of the tibia was completed w/ im drill followed per broach impactor. at this point trial fempo and tibial components were reduced using a 12 mm trial liner. the range of motion and stability in both flexion and extension was satisfactory. no further soft tissue release was indicated. i was able to achieve 0 degrees of extension and complete flexion of the knee. attention was now placed for the preparation of the patella. using a patellar caliper the thickness was measured to be 21.5 mm. this gives an ideal resection of 8.5 mm keeping 13 mm of bone intact. reaming was initiated w a patellar reamer reaming up to 13 mm w/ the reaming alignment guide. using a caliper the resected patella was measured which was noted to be 13 mm. a 32 sizer was noted to accommodate the resected surface very well. drilling was completed and trial 32 button was inserted wo any diff. the tracking was satisfactory. there was no evidence of any subluxation or dislocation of the patella. the trial components position was satisfactory. the alignment and the rotation of all 3 components were satisfactory. all the trial components were removed and the wound was thoroughly irrigd w/ pulsavac lavage irrigation mech sys. the resected surfaces were dried w a sponge. two batches of palacos cement were mixed. the cementing was initiated starting w/ tibia followed per femur and patella. excess peripheral cement were removed w/ the curette and knife. the knee was positioned in extension w/ a 12 mm trial liner. patellar clamp was placed p cementing the all-poly patella. once the cement was set hard and cured tourniquet was deflated. hemostasis was achieved. the trial 12 mm liner was replaced w/ definitive prolong highly cross-linked polyethylene liner. range of motion and stability was verified at 0 degrees and flexion of 120 degrees. ant-post drawer test was satisfactory. medial and lat stability was satisfactory. patellar tracking was satisfactory. the wound was thoroughly irrigd. hemostasis was achieved. a local cocktail was injected which included the mixture of 0.25% plain marcaine 30 mg of toradol and 4 mg of morphine. the quadriceps mechanism and dist arthrotomy was repaired w #1 vicryl in figure-of-8 fashion. the subcut closure was performed in layers using 2-0 vicryl and 0 vicryl followed per 2-0 vicryl proxly. the skin was approximated w/ staples. sterile dsgs were placed including xeroform 4x4 abd and bias. the pt was then trxred to the recovery room in a stable condition. there were no intraop complications noted. she tolerated the procedure very well.\n",

2) no evidence of carotid stenosis on the left. history and physical: this is a 56-year-old white male with a history of hypertension for 15 years untreated. the patient woke up at 7: 15 a.m. on march 26 with the sudden onset of right-sided weakness of his arm hand leg and foot and also with a right facial droop right hand numbness on the dorsal side left face numbness and slurred speech. the patient was brought by ems to emergency room. the patient was normal before he went to bed the prior night. he was given aspirin in the er. the ct of the brain without contrast did not show any changes. he could not have a ct with contrast because the machine was broken. he went ahead and had the mri/mra of the brain and neck which showed infarct involving the right basal ganglia and deep white matter of the left parietal lobe. also there is diffuse smooth narrowing of the left middle cerebral artery. the patient was admitted to the micu. hospital course per problem list: 1. acute cerebrovascular accident: the patient was not a candidate for tissue plasminogen activator. a neurology consult was obtained from dr. s. she agrees with our treatment for this patient. the patient was on aspirin 325 mg and also on zocor 20 mg once a day. we also ordered fasting blood lipids which showed cholesterol of 165 triglycerides 180 hdl cholesterol 22 ldl cholesterol 107. dr. farber agreed to treat the risk factors to not treat blood pressure for the first two weeks of the stroke. we put the patient on p.r.n. labetalol only for systolic blood pressure greater than 200 diastolic blood pressure greater than 120. the patient's blood pressure has been stable and he did not need any blood pressure medications. his right leg kept improving with increased muscle strength and it was 4-5/5 however his right upper extremity did not improve much and was 0-1/5. his slurred speech has been improved a little bit. the patient started pt ot and speech therapy on the second day of hospitalization. the patient was transferred out to a regular floor on the same day of admission based on his stable neurologic exam. also we added aggrenox for secondary stroke prevention suggested by dr. f. echocardiogram was ordered and showed normal left ventricular function with bubble study that was negative. carotid ultrasound only showed mild stenosis on the right side. ekg did not show any changes so the patient will be transferred to siskin rehabilitation hospital today on aggrenox for secondary stroke prevention. he will not need blood pressure treatment unless systolic is greater than 220 diastolic greater than 120 for the first week of his stroke. on discharge on his neurologic exam he has a right facial palsy from the eye below he has right upper extremity weakness with 0-1/5 muscle strength right leg is 4-5/5 improved slurred speech. 2. hypertension: as i mentioned in item #1 see above his blood pressure has been stable. this did not need any treatment. 3. urinary tract infection: the patient had urinalysis on march 26th which showed a large amount of leukocyte esterase small amount of blood with red blood cells 34 white blood cells 41 moderate amount of bacteria. the patient was started on cipro 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. on march 26th. he needs to finish seven days of antibiotic treatment for his uti. urine culture and sensitivity were negative. 4. hypercholesterolemia: the patient was put on zocor 20 mg p.o. daily. the goal ldl for this patient will be less than 70. his ldl currently is 107 hdl is 22 triglycerides 180 cholesterol is 165. condition on discharge: stable. activity: as tolerated. diet: low-fat low-salt cardiac diet. discharge instructions: 1. take medications regularly. 2. pt ot speech therapist to evaluate and treat at siskin rehab hospital. 3. continue cipro for an additional two days for his uti. discharge medications: 1. cipro 250 mg one tablet p.o. b.i.d. for an additional two days. 2. aggrenox one tablet p.o. b.i.d. 3. docusate sodium 100 mg one cap p.o. b.i.d. 4. zocor 20 mg one tablet p.o. at bedtime. 5. prevacid 30 mg p.o. once a day. follow up: 1. the patient needs to follow up with rehabilitation hospital after he is discharged from there. 2. the patient can call the clinic if he needs a follow up appointment with us or the patient can find a primary care physician since he has insurance.\",\n  'discharge diagnoses: 1. acute cerebrovascular accident/left basal ganglia and deep white matter of the left parietal lobe. 2. hypertension. 3. urinary tract infection. 4. hypercholesterolemia. procedures: 1. on 3/26/2006 portable chest single view. impression: atherosclerotic change in the aortic knob. 2. on 3/26/2006 chest portable single view. impression: mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta maybe secondary to hypertension; right lateral costophrenic angle is not evaluated due to positioning of the patient. 3. on march 27 2006 swallowing study: normal swallowing study with minimal penetration with thin liquids. 4. on march 26 2006 head ct without contrast: 1) air-fluid level in the right maxillary sinus suggestive of acute sinusitis; 2) a 1.8-cm oval low density mass in the dependent portion of the left maxillary sinus and ethmoid sinuses. 4. iv contrast ct scan of the head is unremarkable. 5. on 3/26/2006 mri/mra of the brain without contrast did not show any changes. he could not have a ct with contrast because the machine was broken. he went ahead and had the mri/mra of the brain and neck which showed infarct involving the right basal ganglia and deep white matter of the left parietal lobe. also there is diffuse smooth narrowing of the left middle cerebral artery. the patient was admitted to the micu. hospital course per problem list: 1. acute cerebrovascular accident: the patient was not a candidate for treatment of hypertension. the patient was on aspirin 325 mg and also on zocor 20 mg once a day. we also ordered fasting blood lipids which showed cholesterol of 165 triglycerides 180 hdl cholesterol 22 ldl cholesterol 107. the patient was started on zocor 20 mg p.o. daily. the goal ldl for this patient will be less than 70. his ldl currently is 107 hdl is 22 triglycerides 180 cholesterol is 165. condition on discharge:')]"

    "- The above means that if the model saw an acab in training, it identified it and substituted it 100% of the time, whether or not it was the correct substitution is described below. We will need to do a confusion matrix for this.\n",
    "- The confusion matrix for (accuracy, recall, preciscion, F1, sensitivity and specifity is going to take me a bit\n",
    "- The reason for time need to compute confusion matrix is because I cannot automate knowing if the correct acab long form was subbed, or else we wouldn't need this model\n",
    "- I calculated a representative sample size to extrapolate these terms, it will require manually reviewing 182 samples\n",
    "- Otherwise the model did really well on basic sanity checks, which means we are taking the right approach (described below)\n",
    "- Additionally, if we have good confusion matrix scores, this model literally took a day to train, compared to the nature paper which would've taken 4 years or whatever larry calculated.\n",
    "- Some of the training data did not include resolved abbreviations, for example 'ct' remained ct in the target text, so ct would not be resolved\n",
    "- I think lower casing the text may make it difficult to differentiate certain tokens for dejargoning, we should avoid this for the full model\n",
    "- Something to be concerned about with GPT or T5 models in this use case is \"hallucinations\", aka ramblings to a prompt, or deviation from original text\n",
    "- I didn't see a lot of hallucinations and overall it had high fidelity (little to no changing of original text unless it was an ACAB), still\n",
    "- Some input had text chopped off at the end, we need to investigate whether this was from allowable sequence length, or if because the model thinks a semi colon means new input\n"
